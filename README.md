# OsrsHelper-rewrite
A Discord bot mostly made for Old School Runescape related commands. This is a discord.py-rewrite version of 
[OsrsHelper](https://github.com/Visperi/OsrsHelper). The functionality is pretty limited at the moment, but the main 
goal is to make the code more efficient and readable. I aim to update this project regularly, but the old 
version already has a live user base and hence will still be in the main focus.

# Commands
For currently available commands see [COMMANDS](COMMANDS.md) file for a quick reference. At some point, more helpful 
custom help messages will be added to the bot. For now, this is not at the top of the priority list.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- MySQL 8.0+ and a database

For packages see `requirements.txt`. Most of them should be installed automatically during the installation of 
discord.py. If not installing straight from requirements file, at least following packages need to be installed 
manually:

- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `mysqlclient`
- `numpy`
- `tabulate`
